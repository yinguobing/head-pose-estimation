Features coming soon:
- Train with PyTorch

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

![TensorFlow](https://img.shields.io/badge/TensorFlow-v2.4-brightgreen)
![OpenCV](https://img.shields.io/badge/OpenCV-v4.5-brightgreen)
![Numpy](https://img.shields.io/badge/Numpy-v1.19-brightgreen)

The code was tested on Ubuntu 20.04 and macOS Big Sur.

### Installing

This repository already provided a pre-trained model for facial landmarks detection. Just git clone then you are good to go.

```bash
# From your favorite development directory:
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/yinguobing/head-pose-estimation.git
```

## Running

A video file or a webcam index should be assigned through arguments. If no source provided, the built in webcam will be used by default.

### With video file

For any video format that OpenCV supports (`mp4`, `avi` etc.):

```bash
python3 main.py --video /path/to/video.mp4
```

### With webcam

The webcam index should be provided:

```bash
python3 main.py --cam 0
``` 

## How it works

There are three major steps:

1. Face detection. A face detector is introduced to provide a face bounding box containing a human face. Then the face box is expanded and transformed to a square to suit the needs of later steps.

2. Facial landmark detection. A pre-trained deep learning model take the face image as input and output 68 facial landmarks.

3. Pose estimation. After getting 68 facial landmarks, the pose could be calculated by a mutual PnP algorithm.

## Retrain the model

To retrain the facial landmark detection model, please refer to this series of [posts](https://yinguobing.com/deeplearning/) (in Chinese only). The training code is also open sourced: https://github.com/yinguobing/cnn-facial-landmark

The 3D model of face comes from OpenFace, you can find the original file [here](https://github.com/TadasBaltrusaitis/OpenFace/blob/master/lib/local/LandmarkDetector/model/pdms/In-the-wild_aligned_PDM_68.txt).

The build in face detector comes from OpenCV.
