"""Demo code shows how to estimate human head pose.
Currently, human face is detected by a detector from an OpenCV DNN module.
Then the face box is modified a little to suits the need of landmark
detection. The facial landmark detection is done by a custom Convolutional
Neural Network trained with TensorFlow. After that, head pose is estimated
by solving a PnP problem.
